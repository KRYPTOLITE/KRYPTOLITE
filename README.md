- 👋 Hi, I’m <b>@KRYPTOLITE</b>, a multi-chain DeFi protocol designed to allow our community <i>earn passively</i> without the demands of active portfolio management.
- 👀 I’m interested in sensitising and educating the general public on the key role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols.
- 🌱 I’m currently building our NFT marketplace, where you can mint, share and sell NFTs. And working on our own blockchain technology!
- 💞️ I’m proud to collaborate with other sectors of the economy like, education, automobiles, ICT, logistics and energy generation so that KRL, our native platform utility token will be used to cater for everyday needs, while at the same time creating job opportunities for many.
